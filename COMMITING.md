Hi this just Says how i'll probably commit:
That is when A file i have done to a Effecient and working standard 
This maybe why my commits may be erattic or just plain wierd
For this reason my Version control is strange as i will start on Version 1 then work upwards to 2(by Large Edits etc..) 
as soon as it gets to 3 though i will create a complete rewrite of the 
code keeping it reatvily fresh,new and gernrally more tidy and less spreadic.
Moreover I will keep the Interlization files to the last as they are less iportant(at this stage)
Thanks For Reading Ethan.
